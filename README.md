# Guitar Hero Midi Synth
Yes Yes, so I'm sure you've spent countless hours in your room, air-strumming your guitar hero controller and wishing that it could be a reaaal guitar. Well, now it is! boot up this program, open your favorite synth and get strumming!

### WARNING: I am not a music theory expert. Forgive my blasphemous lack of knowledge of music terminology.

By default, it looks for a controller on port 0, which is the default for my xbox 360 guitar hero guitar. Your mileage may vary.
The mappings are as follows:

## Color buttons: 
The colors buttons map to the minor pentatonic scale, with the root note on RED
(or the major pentatonic scale with the root note on YELLOW)

press one to play a sound. Yippee!

## strummer thing
it's an octave shifter. Hold it up to jump an octave up, etc.

## whammy bar
It's a pitch shifter, fully pressed, it shifts +2 semitones

## star power button

This is a modifier that shifts each note up by either 1 or 2 semitones depending on which I thought sounded cooler at the time of writing the code.


with a little bit of luck and a lot of harry houdini shit, it is possible to play all 12 notes in the ocave with this setup I think. You might need to press the star power button and hold the whammy bar down at the time time to get the flat 2nd and the sharp 6th, assuming the root note is still the RED.

Good luck!
